Employee Database Project
Overview
This project is centered around the creation and analysis of an employee database, diving into SQL queries to uncover insights about employee roles, departments, and salaries.

Prerequisites
We should Ensure that we  have the following installed to get started:

PostgreSQL (Version 12+): Our chosen database management system for its robust features.
pgAdmin 4: A user-friendly interface for managing PostgreSQL databases.

Setup
During the class we followed these steps to set up your environment:

Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin as per the official documentation.
Create a new database titled employee_db using pgAdmin.
Execute the provided SQL scripts to build your database schema and populate it with the provided data.

Project Journey
Data Modeling: Began with analyzing our data set to sketch out an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
Data Engineering: Developed the database schema, focusing on table creation, data types, and establishing relationships.
Data Analysis: Conducted detailed SQL queries to draw valuable insights from our employee database.
Tools & Technologies
SQL & PostgreSQL: For database creation and manipulation.
QuickDBD: To visually map out our database schema.
